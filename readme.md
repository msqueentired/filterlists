# Abandon Hope, All Ye Who Enter Here!

This is a collection of filter lists I've assembled for PiHole installs I manage.

## Current Lists

* [Crypto.txt](lists/crypto.txt) - Blocks DeFi, DExes, and Currency project pages. (*5222 entries*)
  * May contain false positives. Please create an issue if you discover one!
* [Hate.txt](lists/hate.txt) - Websites associated with hate groups as designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center *(76 entries)*

## Todo

* Update the [crypto scraper](crawler/scrape_crypto.py) so that it takes an argument instead of the hardcoded debug flag.
